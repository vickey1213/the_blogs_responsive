      "## UI Design draft:\n",
      "The app should have a simple and intuitive user interface. It should have a camera button on the main screen to capture food images. After capturing an image, the app should display the recognized food item along with its name and a thumbnail image. Tapping on the recognized food item should open a detailed view with additional information such as nutritional value and recipes. The app should also have a search bar to manually search for food items. The search results should be displayed in a list format with thumbnails and names. The app should have a settings menu to customize preferences and enable/disable certain features.\n",
